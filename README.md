In this course, you'll learn how to use the standard libraries that come bundled in with every installation of Ruby. Tuts+ instructor José Mota will teach you how to:
- manipulate YAML, CSV and JSON data
- apply delegation for better
- fetch content from the web using `Net::HTTP` and the URI library
- build a Rake tasks
- manage files

You'll be amazed how much can be accomplished using only the standard Ruby libraries! Each library will be taught with simple examples and exercises that you can adapt for your own programming problems.
